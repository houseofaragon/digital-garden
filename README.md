# Collaborative Digital Garden 

This application is a collaborative digital garden. What's that you say? I'm glad you asked.

A digital garden is where ideas live and where ideas grow. Users 
write down thoughts, add links to things they want to share, add photos
that inspire.

This particular digital garden is built with local-first software in mind. What's that you say? Again. I'm so glad you asked.

Local-first software means your data is your own and data is stored primarily on your local machine - though it eventually can live in a central database. At it's core, its a distributed model.

This application is also built with the ethos of home-cooked software. What's that you say?! This time I'm ecstatic! you asked. 

Home-cooked software is software you make for people you love, like a home cooked meal. You make it because it enriches your life, and not your pockets. Though if it lined your pocket, that couldn't hurt.

# App + CRDTs

The app is built on top of [Yjs](https://docs.yjs.dev/). Thank you Yjs for making my journey into CRDT's so seemless. Wait, wait. What's a CRDT you say?!?
:)

CRDT's stands for Conflict-free Replicated Data Type. This is a very special and unique data structure that is replicated and shared across a network of friends.
